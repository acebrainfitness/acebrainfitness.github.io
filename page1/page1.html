<h2 class="hbody">Individual Training Program</h2>
<p class="hbody"> ACE Brain Fitness provides one-on-one intense training focused on a student’s individual needs, as determined by a skills assessment.</p>
<p class="hbody"><strong>Is your child or someone you know struggling with academics?</strong></p>
<p class="hbody">You may be spending extra time helping your child or have tried tutoring with little or no success. The problem could be weak cognitive skills – the skills that form the foundation for learning. A cognitive skills assessment can identify whether this is the case. Learning can be difficult if the underlying skills are not developed. </p>
<p class="hbody">Cognitive skills like attention, working memory, logic and reasoning, and processing speed need to be developed for a student to be able to take in information, understand it, and quickly use it. Cognitive training builds these underlying skills that must be in place for learning to occur.</p>
<p class="hbody">ACE Brain Fitness provides one-on-one training focused on the student's personal needs. A cognitive skills assessment identifies the areas of greatest concern and these skills are then strengthened through an individualized brain fitness program.<br />
  <br />
</p>
<p class="hbody"><strong>Have you or has someone you know suffered from a traumatic brain injury?</strong></p>
<p class="hbody">Some common symptoms after undergoing a traumatic brain injury include memory loss, lack of focus, poor problem solving and decision making, poor reading comprehension, and difficulty with organization and multi-tasking. Research has shown that cognitive training can significantly improve the ability of patients with chronic brain injury to maintain attention on goals and execute tasks – skills these patients often lack as a result of their injuries. </p>
<p class="hbody">If you recognize these symptoms in yourself or someone else, get professional help. </p>
<p class="hbody">ACE Brain Fitness offers training that focuses on skills weakened by a traumatic brain injury. <br />
</p>
<p class="hbody"><strong>Do you have a student that will be taking the ACT test?</strong></p>
<p class="hbody">Getting a competitive score on the ACT test can be essential to getting into the college of  choice, as well as improving the chance of qualifying for a scholarship.<br />
  <br />
ACE Brain Fitness offers a skill building/ACT prep course designed  to maximize  potential through a unique combination of cognitive skills training along with practical ACT test-taking techniques.</p>
