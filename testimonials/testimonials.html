<p class="hbody">Our eight year old daughter was struggling academically and behaviorally in school. After trying many things, we decided to find help outside the classroom. MJ with ACE Brain Fitness was a breath of fresh air! We had our first consultation at the beginning of summer and she explained to us the certain skills required for an elementary school student to be successful. She also made it clear that if a child lacked strength in these areas that things would be more difficult for them.  We signed up for the three month program and after just a few weeks we were already seeing a difference in our daughter's logic and reasoning levels, as well as her processing speeds. </p>
<p class="hbody">After completing the program we saw a huge improvement in her behavior. She is able to focus more easily and for longer periods of time, she uses logic and reasoning in ways that we had not expected (in good ways of course), she speaks with more confidence and is able to clearly state what she is thinking and/or feeling. She is able to listen to more than one instruction at a time and does not need to be reminded nearly as much as before. Her math skills have significantly improved and while she still struggles a bit with reading she has improved by leaps and bounds. The relationship that cultivated between MJ and our daughter is a special one that we hope will continue; she was always excited for her sessions at ACE!  Our daughter started 3rd grade this year, and her teachers made numerous comments about the significant gains she had made in such a short time. We are extremely grateful to MJ for the special attention, care and comfort she has shown. We were so impressed with the results that we asked if there was a &quot;maintenance&quot; plan so that our daughter could continue to build and maintain her skills throughout the school year. <br />

<p class="hbody">School has been easier for him this year than it ever was in the past. It has been a year since he completed the training, and he has retained the improvements.<br />

<p class="hbody">I just want to say that your son has made some real nice progress this year. I am very proud of him.  Yesterday in math he did some two digit addition <u>with regrouping</u> all by himself.  I am really impressed with his reading...truly I am. He is really doing some awesome work.<br /> 
<em>- Teacher of ACE student </em></p>
<p class="hbody">On our daughter's report card she has always needed work with her peers, following direction, controlling her actions and paying attention in class.<br />
  All of these went from being very poor marks to improved.
  At home she would get very frustrated when asked to do more than 1 or 2 tasks at a time and now she can be told to do 3 things and not be reminded.
  She is learning to use coping  skills that she seems to have never had.  She is starting to think before she reacts.<br />

<p class="hbody">We have been very satisfied with her outcome so far and hope that it can continue. Thank you for working with her!!!<br />

<p class="hbody">ACE Brain Fitness was a fantastic experience for our children. We had one elementary student and one high school student participate. All the gains by our high school student will help him significantly as he takes the ACT test as well as in his college career. The significant gains by our elementary student will help her through her entire education. We are amazed and encouraged by the progress our children made and would strongly recommend ACE Brain Fitness.<br />
