<h2 class="hbody">Stay Sharp Curriculum</h2>
<p class="hbody">Our brains cognitively decline as we age, but this can be reversed through training. Brain exercises build brain strength resulting in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Better memory</li>
  <li>Improved attention spans and ability to concentrate</li>
  <li>Reduced risk for Alzheimer's</li>
</ul>
<p class="hbody">Stay Sharp is a hands-on comprehensive curriculum that addresses cognitive functioning, incorporating social interaction with focused mental activities. Creation and growth of new brain cells may occur at any age in response to new learning challenges. The Stay Sharp program is designed to effectively use the brain's ability to create new neural connections. It is formatted to be used in small groups and can be administered by activities directors in senior care facilities ranging from senior centers to assisted living communities to nursing homes. The program is effective as a preventative measure to maintain mental acuity or to help reverse cognitive decline. The package includes the brain fitness curriculum booklet, a training DVD, and materials for administering the program. The curriculum is reusable; once you have it you can use it indefinitely. Stay Sharp offers an effective way to help seniors maintain cognitive functioning and provides a way for your facility to stand apart as one that specifically offers a cognitive training program.<br />
