<p class="hbody"><strong>Do you feel yourself losing some of your mental edge? What can you do to maintain your mental sharpness?</strong></p>
<p class="hbody">As we age, our brains lose sharpness. Brain activities can help prevent age-related decline, reverse dementia, and improve normally functioning minds. Studies have found that mentally active seniors reduced their risk of dementia by as much as 75% compared to those who do not stimulate their minds.</p>
<p class="hbody">Brain fitness involves doing activities that are designed to maintain mental sharpness. The challenges  use visual, auditory, and hands-on activities. Involving hands is important, as it engages different areas of the brain. Adults who have participated in brain fitness have observed maintaining and improving their memory, greater awareness of what's happening around them, better organization, better focus, and regaining confidence.</p>
<p class="hbody">A weekly brain fitness class or involvement in a Stay Sharp Club can help maintain mental sharpness.</p>
<p class="hbody"><strong>What is a Stay Sharp Club?</strong></p>
<p class="hbody">The best way to maintain mental sharpness is by regularly doing brain fitness activities. Social interaction is also an important element in staying sharp. A Stay Sharp Club is a group of people getting together to do brain fitness activities. The group meets at a place and time of its choosing, making it convenient for the members. As a member of a Stay Sharp Club, you will receive materials and instructions for each club meeting. You can have fun with a group as you maintain your mental sharpness. </p>
<p class="hbody"><strong>What is a Brain Fitness Class?</strong></p>
<p class="hbody">Brain fitness classes incorporate mental activities with social interaction in a fun environment. ACE Brain Fitness offers adult group brain fitness classes in the Wabasha, MN area. New sessions starting on demand.</p>
<p class="hbody"><strong>How is brain fitness different from puzzles or computer-based games?</strong></p>
<p class="hbody">Computer-based learning games can have some value, but it is limited. They are one-dimensional, and the benefits do not transfer to daily life as well as hands-on activities that incorporate all the senses.</p>
<p class="hbody">Puzzles like Sudoku and Crosswords can be beneficial, but they are missing elements that are important for mental sharpness. If you do a lot of Sudoku puzzles, you will be good at Sudoku, but you still may not know what you did with the car keys. If you do a lot of Crossword puzzles, you will be good at Crosswords, but you still may struggle with remembering names. You need to do a variety of activities. </p>
<p class="hbody">A weekly brain fitness class or involvement in a Stay Sharp Club can help maintain mental sharpness through specially designed activities.<br />
</p>
<p class="hbody"><strong>Why does brain fitness work?</strong></p>
<p class="hbody">The brain structure remains plastic throughout life, which is referred to as neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is the nerve cells’ ability to change and modify their activities. Neural connections can be strengthened or restructured in response to new learning challenges. These challenges change the brain's wiring, enlarging its capacity to learn. Activities are formatted to most effectively use the brain’s ability to construct new connections, developing and maintaining mental sharpness.</p>
<p class="hbody">ACE Brain Fitness offers these specially designed activities through one-on-one training, group classes, and Stay Sharp clubs. </p>
