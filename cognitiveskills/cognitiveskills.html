<p class="hbody">Cognitive skills training addresses the following:<br />
</p>
<h3>Attention</h3>
<p class="hbody">Sustained Attention enables you to stay on task for a period of time.<br />
  Selective Attention enables you to stay on task even when a distraction is present.<br />
  Divided Attention allows you to handle two or more tasks at one time.<br />
  The inability to stay on task for long periods of time, to ignore distractions, or to multi-task will limit the student's other cognitive skills, which will impact all academic areas.<br />
  </p>
<h3>Working Memory<br />
  </h3>
<p class="hbody">Working Memory is the ability to retain information for short periods if time while processing it or using it.<br />
  Learning suffers if information cannot be retained long enough to be handled properly.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Memory<br />
  </h3>
<p class="hbody">Long-Term Memory is the ability to both store and recall information for later use.<br />
  If the ability to store and retrieve information is poor, wrong conclusions and incorrect answers will result.<br />
  </p>
<h3>Processing Speed<br />
  </h3>
<p class="hbody">Processing Speed is the rate at which the brain handles information.<br />
  If processing speed is slow, the information held in working memory may be lost before it can be used, and the student will have to begin again.<br />
  </p>
<h3>Logic and Reasoning<br />
  </h3>
<p class="hbody">Logic and reasoning skills are the abilities to reason, prioritize, and plan.<br />
  If these skills are not strong, academic activities such as problem solving, math, and comprehension will be difficult.<br />
  </p>
<h3>Visual Processing<br />
  </h3>
<p class="hbody">Visual Processing is the ability to perceive, analyze, and think in visual images.<br />
  Visual Discrimination is seeing differences in size, color, shape, distance, and the orientation of objects.<br />
  Visualization is creating mental images.<br />
  When visual imagery is poor, tasks like word math problems and comprehension, which require seeing the concept/object in the student's mind, are difficult.<br />
  </p>
<h3>Auditory Processing<br />
  </h3>
<p class="hbody">Auditory Processing is the ability to perceive, analyze, and conceptualize, what is heard and is one of the major underlying skills needed to learn to read and spell.<br />
  Auditory Discrimination is hearing differences in sounds, including volume, pitch, duration, and phoneme.<br />
  Phonemic Awareness is the ability to segment sounds, to blend sounds to make words, to break words apart into separate sounds, and to manipulate and analyze sounds to determine the number, sequence, and sounds within a word.<br />
  If blending, segmenting, and sound analysis are weak, sounding out words when reading and spelling will be difficult and error-prone.</p>
